Retrieve the details of all orders placed on a specific date:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = ?;
Retrieve the details of all items whose stock has fallen below the reorder level:
SELECT items.* FROM items JOIN inventory ON items.id = inventory.item_id WHERE inventory.quantity < items.reorder_level;
update:
UPDATE inventory SET quantity = ? WHERE item_id = ?;

SQL query to retrieve the remaining quantity of items from the items table:
SELECT name, (quantity - SUM(quantity_sold)) as remaining_quantity
FROM items
LEFT JOIN (SELECT item_id, SUM(quantity) as quantity_sold
           FROM orders
           GROUP BY item_id) as sold
ON items.id = sold.item_id
GROUP BY items.id;

You can also use the same query with a condition to check for a specific item.
SELECT name, (quantity - SUM(quantity_sold)) as remaining_quantity
FROM items
LEFT JOIN (SELECT item_id, SUM(quantity) as quantity_sold
           FROM orders
           GROUP BY item_id) as sold
ON items.id = sold.item_id
WHERE name = "ItemName"
GROUP BY items.id;
